<h1>Good Arguments</h1>
<h2>A guide to understanding the intellectual and ethical rot in Americans' minds, lives, culture, religions and
	government</h2>
<h3 class="authorLine">by Edward Tanguay</h3>
<p>This book is a sequel to a book I began writing in 2016 called <a href="https://onespace.netlify.app/ifc">Raising
		the Intellectual and Ethical Bar in the American Culture</a> which I abandoned in 2020 after years of
	research engaging in argumentative conversations with Americans online and off revealed that the goal of the
	book is impossible without a structural change in the American character (for a good insight into the American
	character, see Kurt Andersen's <a
	   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fantasyland-America-Haywire-500-Year-History/dp/0812978900">Fantasyland: How
		America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History</a>).
</p>
<p>The book <em>Good Arguments</em> is the result of what any honest and curious person would do who grew up in a
	culture in which they gradually realize that everyone including their closest family and friends are corrupt and
	dysfunctional: investigate the reasons why.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of arguments that have been improved and sharpened throughout the years through
	hundreds of conversations.</p>
<p>The common characteristic of these arguments is that their conclusions are as obvious as they are emotionally
	triggering to Americans. For example, suggest to any American that they should rewrite their Constitution since
	it was written by 18th century slave owners (a good idea based on obvious fact) and you can watch in real time as
	any rational
	faculty that previously existed in their mind is extinguished as control of their organism is replaced by
	fearful, triggered emotion drawing on a lifetime of accumulated national myth and propaganda. If you are lucky,
	they will also have a mind sopped in ancient fake news they refer to as a religion which combines with shallow,
	dogmatic patriotism to produce an explosive cocktail which leads to a stream of hilarious, emotional fireworks until
	they block or defriend you so that you never hear from them again.</p>
<p>This book is foremost expository. I guarantee you if you introduce these arguments to your American friends,
	family, work colleagues, church members, fellow students, professors, etc., pursue the conversation
	by asking follow-up questions, revealing contradictions they make, and demanding they make sense when they talk, you
	will discover the intellectual and ethical rot in individual Americans that I have discovered. What you do with this
	newfound knowledge is up to
	you.</p>
<p>As for me, learning over the years to speak freely and honestly, being able to have the courage to argue what is
	obviously true, to back up one's claims with fact and good argument, to allow your opinion to be moved by good
	argument, to not allow oneself to be bullshitted and gaslighted by strangers, friends and family, and to rigorously
	counter trolls and smear goons, has led to a wholesale exudus of bullshitters and gaslighters from my life, which
	have been replaced by more honest
	and sincere people.</p>
<h3>Good Arguments:</h3>

<h4>The American Consitution should be replaced by a new one since the old one was written by 18th century slave owners.
	At best this is horrible symbolism.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Award for most emotionally unhinged, hillbilly response to this argument was from an American on Twitter who
		assumed I was
		German since I live in Berlin: "You better shut up and mind your own business or we'll roll our tanks back
		through your country."</li>
	<li>Greatest loss suffered by posing this argument: former middle-school sweetheart defriended me on
		Facebook. Apparently these American bores are more interesting when you're going through puberty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>American education and entertainment sports should be completely separated.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>American high schools and universities should repurpose their stadiums into Greek agoras where politics
		and philosophy are discussed and debated.</li>
	<li>American students who make up cute little names for their sports teams like "the tigers" or "the bears" or "the
		rangers" are clowns. Better: join a local sports team not connected with your academic experience, anything
		so that you are not obese like 40% of the American population. And leave it to kindergarteners to refer to
		themselves with cute little group names.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Human rights are more important than corporate rights.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This means that companies that allow people to communicate are obligated to not delete any speech nor make any
		rules about what topics can or cannot be discussed.</li>
	<li> If anyone breaks any law with their speech, we have democratically elected officials and a democratic court
		system that will take care of that.</li>
	<li>If companies don't want to respect the human right of free speech, they shouldn't start a communication company,
		or should go operate in North Korea where suppressing free speech is common.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mount Rushmore should be legally destroyed, the rubble sold off to educate Americans on democracy.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Mount Rushmore was created primarily to lure tourists, make a profit off people who would otherwise be too
		uninterested to travel to South Dakota</li>
	<li>Mount Rushmore has become another way to marinate Americans' minds with bombastic, nationalistic propaganda.</li>
	<li>Mount Rushmore is a monument to a democracy that failed. Thomas Jefferson and Lincoln would be horrified to see
		themselves depicted as larger-than-life kings or gods carved into a mountain, the act of which goes against
		every
		idea of democracy they stood for.</li>
	<li>The Mount Rushmore tourist center should be converted into an international conference center that promotes
		discussions on democracy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Atheists are as dogmatic and confused about the nature of God as are monotheists, while we polytheists are the
	most responsible pracitioners of religion.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Gods exist to the extent that people base their social actions on their religious beliefs, and this can be proven, particularly when people believe in the same god in groups and gaslight and intimidate other people with these beliefs, as Mormons have made a business model out of, and as Christians and Islamists do in order to intimidate and scare even friends and family and sway political opinion and law-making in their societies.</li>
	<li>So a god is a force that is created by humans and made to exist in the world through human belief: and it is a real and a measurable force. Hence atheists' claims that Gods don't really exist in the real world are wrong, confused and moot.</li>
	<li>Monotheists' claims that Gods exist in the real world independently of believe are equally wrong, confused and moot. There is absolutely no proof of this or that God exists outside human belief while other Gods do not, while there is overwhelming proof that people argue that this or that God exists in order to try to gaslight and bullshit other people with the intention of controlling their behavior and swaying political opinion. And this can be proven.</li>
	<li>Hence atheists and monotheists are equally wrong and confused.</li>
	<li>It turns out that polytheists are the most spiritually well-adjusted and have beliefs of the world that are most rooted in physical and psychological reality. As a polytheist, I believe in any god that is of use to me, so if your God is interesting or powerful, then it joins my Pantheon as well. However, I may not adopt certain religious laws commonly associated with your god, and may do some necessary tweaking here and there, but it doesn't matter since religion is based on utter bullshit anyway, the important thing is to make it bullshit that moves you emotionally, and to not unfairly to try bullshit and gaslight other people into thinking or fearing that your bullshit gods exists beyond human belief.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, atheists in their dogmatic stubbornness and moot anti-God bitterness miss out on this positive, uplifting and motivating experience of believing in gods that they rest of us are enjoying. They are alone in their meaningless universe instead of connected to the divine as we are, and they miss out on allowing this spiritual practice to shape their understanding of who they are and their purpose in the world. In fact, atheists are even worse off than brainwashed, bullshitting monotheists: they are just as confused about reality and don't even have a god on their side.</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>The Republican and Democratic parties operate primarily to make money for corporations, mass media, and the military, and have as a primary goal to entertain the American population so that they don't seriously discuss this or vote for third parties.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The primary metaphor of American politics has become All-Star Wrestling: Everyone knows that it is a charade, but enough people are making money on it being such and so have an economic interest in keeping it this way.</li>
</ul>
