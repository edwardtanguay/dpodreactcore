	<h1>Good Arguments</h1>
	<h2>A guide to understanding the intellectual and ethical rot in Americans' minds, lives, culture, religions and
		government</h2>
	<h3 class="authorLine">by Edward Tanguay</h3>
	<p>This book is a sequel to a book I began writing in 2016 called <a href="https://onespace.netlify.app/ifc">Raising
			the Intellectual and Ethical Bar in the American Culture</a> which I abandoned in 2020 after years of
		research engaging in argumentative conversations with Americans online and off revealed that the goal of the
		book is impossible without a structural change in the American character (for a good insight into the American
		character, see Kurt Andersen's <a
		   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fantasyland-America-Haywire-500-Year-History/dp/0812978900">Fantasyland: How
			America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History</a>).
	</p>
	<p>The book <em>Good Arguments</em> is the result of what any honest and curious person would do who grew up in a
		culture in which they gradually realize that everyone including their closest family and friends are corrupt and
		dysfunctional: investigate the reasons why.</p>
	<p>This book is a collection of arguments that have been improved and sharpened throughout the years through literally hundreds of conversations. The common characteristic of these arguments is that their conclusions are as obvious as they are emotionally triggering to Americans. For example, suggest to an American that they should rewrite their Constitution since it was written by slave owners (a good idea based on fact) and you can watch in real time as any rational faculty that previously existed in their mind is extinguished as control of their organism is replaced by fearful, triggered emotion drawing on a lifetime of accumulated national myth and propaganda. If you are lucky, they will also have a mind sopped in ancient fake news they refer to as religion, and there will be no end to the emotional fireworks until they block or defriend you so that you never hear from them again.</p>
	<p>This book is foremost expository. I guarantee you if you introduce these arguments to your American friends, family, work colleagues, church members, fellow students and professors, etc. you will discover the intellectual and ethical rot in individual Americans that I have discovered. What you do with this newfound knowledge and experience is up to you.</p>
	<p>As for me, learning over the years to speak freely and honestly, being able to argue what is obviously true, to back up one's claims with fact and good argument, to rigorously counter trolls and smear goons, has led to a wholesale exudus of bullshitters and gaslighters from my life, being replaced with much more honest, sincere and intellectual interesting people.</p>
