<h1>Good Arguments</h1>
<h2>A guide to understanding the intellectual and ethical rot in Americans' minds, lives, culture, religions and
	government</h2>
<h3 class="authorLine">by Edward Tanguay</h3>
<p>This book is a sequel to a book I began writing in 2016 called <a href="https://onespace.netlify.app/ifc">Raising
		the Intellectual and Ethical Bar in the American Culture</a> which I abandoned in 2020 after years of
	research engaging in argumentative conversations with Americans online and off revealed that the goal of the
	book is impossible without a structural change in the American character (for a good insight into the American
	character, see Kurt Andersen's <a
	   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fantasyland-America-Haywire-500-Year-History/dp/0812978900">Fantasyland: How
		America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History</a>).
</p>
<p>The book <em>Good Arguments</em> is the result of what any honest and curious person would do who grew up in a
	culture in which they gradually realize that everyone including their closest family and friends are corrupt and
	dysfunctional: investigate the reasons why.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of arguments that have been improved and sharpened throughout the years through
	hundreds of conversations.</p>
<p>The common characteristic of these arguments is that their conclusions are as obvious as they are emotionally
	triggering to Americans. For example, suggest to any American that they should rewrite their Constitution since
	it was written by 18th century slave owners (a good idea based on obvious fact) and you can watch in real time as
	any rational
	faculty that previously existed in their mind is extinguished as control of their organism is replaced by
	fearful, triggered emotion drawing on a lifetime of accumulated national myth and propaganda. If you are lucky,
	they will also have a mind sopped in ancient fake news they refer to as a religion which combines with shallow,
	dogmatic patriotism to produce an explosive cocktail which leads to a stream of hilarious, emotional fireworks until
	they block or defriend you so that you never hear from them again.</p>
<p>This book is foremost expository. I guarantee you if you introduce these arguments to your American friends,
	family, work colleagues, church members, fellow students and professors, etc. and pursue the conversation
	revealing false statements and contradictions they make, you will discover the intellectual and ethical rot in
	individual Americans that I have discovered. What you do with this newfound knowledge and experience is up to
	you.</p>
<p>As for me, learning over the years to speak freely and honestly, being able to have the courage to argue what is
	obviously true, to back up one's claims with fact and good argument, to allow your opinion to be moved by good
	argument, to not allow oneself to be bullshitted and
	gaslighted even by friends and family, to rigorously counter social-media trolls and smear goons, has led to a
	wholesale exudus of bullshitters and gaslighters from my life, which are pleasantly replaced by more honest,
	sincere and intellectually interesting people.</p>
<h4>The American Consitution should be replaced by a new one since the old one was written by 18th century slave owners.
	At best this is horrible symbolism.</h4>

	<li>Award for most emotionally unhinged response to this argument was from an American on Twitter who assumed I was
		German since I live in Berlin: "You better shut up and mind your own business or we'll roll our tanks back
		through your country."</li>
