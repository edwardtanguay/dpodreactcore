	<h1>Good Arguments</h1>
	<h2>A guide to understanding the intellectual and ethical rot in Americans' minds, lives, culture, religions and government</h2>
	<h3 class="authorLine">by Edward Tanguay</h3>
	<p>This book is a sequel to a book I began writing in 2016 called <a href="https://onespace.netlify.app/ifc">Raising
			the Intellectual and Ethical Bar in the American Culture</a> which I abandoned in 2020 after years of research engaging in argumentative conversations with Americans online and off revealed that the goal of the book is impossible without a structural change in the American character (for insights into the American character, see Kurt Andersen's <a href="www.amazon.com/Fantasyland-America-Haywire-500-Year-History/dp/0812978900">Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History</a>). 
	<p>
		<p>The book <em>Good Arguments</em> is the result of what any curious person would do who grew up in a culture that is corrupt and dysfunctional to the point of hopelessness: investigate and expose the reasons why the culture is corrupt and dysfunctional with the goal of forcing a change in people who profit from the culture being corrupt and dysfunctional.</p>
