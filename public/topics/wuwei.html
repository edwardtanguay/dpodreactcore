		On wu-wei and good writing
	</h1>
	<p>
		This reminds me of the concept of wu-wei, a state you attain like The Flow in sports, but for your
		mind, your ethics, your ability to respond effortlessly in any situation in accordance with your virtue.
		Attaining
		this is what one needs to be able to write well, I would say. You don't manually construct great writing, it has
		to
		flow out of you from some source behind you and inside of you. I believe Tolstoy was influenced by this concept
		in
		his fascination with Taoism.
	</p>
	<p>
		Attaining wu-wei by constantly resolving conflicts in your mind, becoming more honest, up-front, open, critical,
		transparent, not being afraid to say what is obvious regardless of the situation or consequences, you expose
		people's ethics. The more that people are involved in corruption in their lives or have contradictions in their
		mind, who are in rigid, shallow relationships, who force their speech and writing to match what they think their
		audience wants to hear, the more they are afraid of people who exude wu-wei i.e. people who simply allow a flow
		of
		unfiltered honesty to arise when they speak or write.

	</p>
	<p>
		Often wu-wei is inhibited by economic and social issues, you can't be freely honest because you would likely
		lose
		your job, your relationships, your status, your reputation, etc. And to the extent you have this fear inside
		you,
		you are not going to be able to produce good writing or live an authentic life.

	</p>
	<p>
		This is why your observation here is probably not rare, it was typically that during the more care-free time of
		life
		in high school or college or before we had a mortgage, a marriage, a family, a career reputation, etc. is when
		we
		felt free to say what was true inside us and were welcome to see how what we said changed ours lives and were
		free,
		relaxed and joyful to go with the flow and see what came from this honesty, where it took our lives.

	</p>
	<p>
		I've lived in Germany since 1993 and I remember key moments back in 2014 after getting on Facebook and being
		appalled at what many of my American family members and friends were posting on Facebook, both on the left and
		the
		right. It was both horrible and fascinating that people I had known all my life would casually post such
		hateful,
		naive, passive-aggressive, manipulative, gullible, backward and shallow statements about people in the name of
		religion, patriotism or a political party, and how silent everyone was about this, nobody countering it, nobody
		being honest about it or even discussing it. I watched as my friends and family gradually defriended and blocked
		each other, migrating into their left and right echo chambers, apparently incapable of engaging in conversation.

	</p>
	<p>
		I deliberated for weeks whether or not I wanted to just come out honest on this and start engaging them on what
		they
		meant by what they said and take a stand and argue publicly with them that what they were saying and doing was
		wrong
		and unethical, and why.

	</p>
	<p>
		There were two or three incidences of people referring to me and my family with horrible ethics that pushed me
		over
		the edge and I decided to open the valve of honesty regardless of the consequences.

	</p>
	<p>
		That was the best decision of my life.

	</p>
	<p>
		I can't count anymore the number of people who, simply because I always speak honestly with them, will now avoid
		conversation with me, or have blocked, defriended, ignore or cherry pick topics of what they will and will not
		discuss with me.

	</p>
	<p>
		As you mention above, if writing is forced and does not flow freely and unfiltered from inside you, it's simply
		not
		interesting. This applies to people in general as well. If what people say and do is forced, to the extent they
		are
		performing for an audience, doing and saying what they feel others will like, they're simply boring people, and
		because they won't talk about certain issues, are most probably corrupt as well to various extents.

	</p>
	<p>
		Pursing wu-wei will make you a better person and a better writer. The caveat here is that in pursuing it, you
		may
		lose your old job, your old relationships, your old status, and your old reputation, but you will get new jobs,
		new
		relationships, a new status, and a new reputation that is based on a flow of honesty bubbling up inside you.
		Enjoy.

		Wu-wei is a broad topic and there are many aspects of it and interpretations. I learned about the concept in a
		history course on the the Warring States period in China in which the development and mutation of the wu-wei was
		followed throughout the Zhou, Confusionism, Laozism, Mozism, etc. In many interpretations it has to do with the
		virtues of a good ruler, which is interesting personal politically and historically, and also martial arts as in
		the
		sense of using your opponent's strength against them, flowing with them as they move.

	</p>
	<p>
		But in terms of your topic here of good writing, wu-wei is a personal, ethical concept, working through
		contradictions in your own mind and life until you have no inhibition to say publicly in any situation what
		occurs
		to you in every moment unfiltered, say it, own it, learn from it, and grow with it. I think when you can do
		that,
		you will also naturally write well when writing naturally comes.

	</p>
	<p>
		I tend to avoid modern, particularly American interpretations of Taoism since it is often warped and watered
		down
		with self-help or profit-related motivations, but this site seems quite sincere in explaining wu-wei in an
		ethical
		sense in modern language: https://yourdayyourtao.org/non-action
