35-Minute Full-Body Kickboxing Workout With Christa DiPaolo
This seems to bee one of Christa's newer videos with a different format, she's not with a group anymore but by herself. The boxing moves get a bit comlicated at times, but as she says, you can vary it as you please, the main thing is you're punching. I might watch this format more for variety but I enjoy the one's where she has two people behind her, there's more interaction and one of them does variations on the exercises so you have that variety as well.
